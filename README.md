# naming
A set of scripts for naming characters or objects.

A base set of scripts for naming characters, or naming objects.

character_naming includes lists of names, and chooses from them randomly. Not recommended for commerical use, as most of the names are taken from existing works.

ship_naming choses from lists to print out a string "A of B", such as "The Fastness of Alexandria". Initially written to name ships in Sins of a Solar Empire.

name_generator generates a name from a list of phonemes, and as such is suitable for commercial use.
