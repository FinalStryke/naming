# naming
A set of scripts for naming characters or objects.

A base set of scripts for naming characters, or naming objects.

character_naming includes lists of names, and chooses from them randomly. Not recommended for commerical use, as most of the names are taken from existing works. Uses a method to remove duplicates, so it is not necessary to check the existing name lists before adding new names.

ship_naming choses from lists to print out a string "The A of B", such as "The Fastness of Alexandria". Initially written to name ships in Sins of a Solar Empire.

name_generator generates a new name from a list of phonemes, and as such is suitable for commercial use.

word_maker generates a word from pure letters. As such, it will sometimes throw out something strange, but it is a good starting point.

The prefixSuffix script is more for fun, combining random prefixes and suffixes.
